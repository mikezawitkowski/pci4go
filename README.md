# pci4go

'pci4go' is a library of concepts illustrated in "Programming Collective Intelligence" by Toby Segaran. (O'Reilly Media Copyright 2007 Toby Segaran, 978-0-596-52932-1)

Inspired by the ruby library [pci4r](https://github.com/alexvollmer/pci4r), this library isn't intended to be a direct port of Segaran's code. Instead, it covers the same concepts in tools that users of Go can use (and improve upon).
